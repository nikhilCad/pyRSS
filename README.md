# pyRSS
An RSS reader made with Python's Tkinter

Todo
-Allowing subscribing to feeds(currently only shows stuff from CNN RSS feeds as it loads fast)
-Add ScrollBar, you can't scroll currently
-Currently it parses only full text of articles, so
  -Support Images
  -Support Videos
  -Support Audios(podcasts)
  -I might need to go to Kivy or PyQt for this idk
